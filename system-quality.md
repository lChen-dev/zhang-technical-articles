### System Quality Attributes

### Availability

System is not 100% available if:
- it sometimes fails to respond to an input
- it repeatedly fails to respond to an input
- it responds but the response is early or late
- it responds with an incorrect value

System availability should be guaranteed in all these states:
- normal operation
- startup
- shutdown
- repair mode
- degraded operation
- overloaded operation

In case of fault, these steps are recommended:
- Log the fault (so that it's possible to understand what happened)
- Notify appropriate entities (people or systems)  

Recover from the fault:  
- Disable source of events causing the fault
- Be temporarily unavailable while repair is being effected
- Fix or mask the fault/failure or contain the damage it causes
- Operate in a degraded mode while repair is being effected

Availability depends on:
- Time to detect the fault
- Time to repair the fault
- Time or time interval in which system can be in degraded mode

#### Availability strategies:

- Ping/echo (with timeout)
- Monitoring of system state
- Heartbeat
- Redundancy: voting, replication, functional redundancy
- Self-test

### Modifability

Modifications differ by:

Source (requester) of a modification: 
- developer
- a system administrator
- an end user

Type of modification:
- Functional
  - addition of a function
  - modification of an existing function
  - deletion of a function
- Non-Functional
  - making system to be more responsive
  - increasing availability
  - increasing performance
  - etc
- Technological:
  - change of a network protocol
  - change of a database type
  - change of hosting method

Scope of modification:
- specific components or modules
- the systemâ€™s platform
- user interface
- system environment
- another system with which it interoperates

Modifability is measured in:
- time (how much time we need to make a change)
- money (how much money we need to make a change)
- scope (how many lines of code you need to make the change)
- defects per modification, risks (how many defects modification can introduce)

#### Modifabilty strategies:

- Reduce coupling
- Increase cohesion
- Reduce size of a module
- Single responsibility principle
